          Meta tags are specific snippets of text and image content that provide
          a summary for a webpage. Often meta tag data shows up whenever someone
          shares a link on social media, in messaging, or in your business chat
          software ðŸ™Œ.

          In addition meta tags can contain information to help search engines
          and other technical services scan your site to figure out what its
          all about and whether or not its legit!
